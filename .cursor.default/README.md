# Cursor Rules

Now with modern AI editors, there's an added layer of config in the form of model rules.

If you want to know why the rules are version controlled like this, read .vscode-default/README.md.

I prefer Cursor to any other editor (GitHub Copilot is okay, probably the best for quick inline debugging for me; Windsurf sucks because they won't let me be a parasite and exploit my school email address to get a free 2 year subscription like GitHub and Cursor let me do).

If you'd like to use, either just rename the folder from .cursor-default to .cursor, or manually add the rules in your Cursor settings/rules tab.
