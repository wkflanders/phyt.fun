# VSCode Rules

These are the general editor rules that I use for VSCode to improve linting and editing QOL. I hate when people version control their settings - it's literal editor assault since pulling a repo that has a version controlled .vscode folder will automatically apply those settings to your editor. There's nothing worse than making a local fork of some project or tool you find interesting, and then the .vscode folder brutally forces itself onto your editor and has fucked all your configs because the dickhead who made the settings had them applied and saved to user configs and not the workspace. However, I like having standardized rules across all my machines (i.e. if I decide to edit a rule on my rig at home, and now need to update it on my Mac). So I just version control the folder but with a name that VSCode won't recognize so that it won't annihilate any local settings. Settings should be workspace rules anyway (so in the event they do apply without permission, deleting the settings.json should hopefully fix it), but it never hurts to be too safe.

If you'd like to use them, either go to your editor's JSON settings and copy and paste them in, make a .vscode folder for the workspace and paste them there, or rename the folder from .vscode-default to .vscode and you're good to go.
